# PriceMarker
This a program that allows users to entre a web link (e.g. a Amazon link) that corresponds to an item (e.g. specific phone) and allows to track the price of the item, outputing a graph with the price and the item name. Each time the graph reloads the program checks if there is a new price and the user can see the change in price from old to new. If theres no change in price there wont be any new dots on the graph for that item. This program allows the user to create and reload different graphs.

## At the moment:

- Works only for Amazon
- It can load / store
- Shows all old prices if there is a price change
